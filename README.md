# PCB Reflow
 A PCB that can help you reflow and solder your SMD components! 

This project is my version of [AfterEarthLTD Solder Plate Reflow](https://github.com/AfterEarthLTD/Solder-Reflow-Plate) (which is an awesome project!). 

## V1.0 - Integrated Heating Bed with Arduino

I decided that I would first recreate the concept of the project (with the heating bed integrated) with more afordable component and add some more funcionality, so I used all PTH components and a Arduino Nano for the MCU. 

The board has a bigger heating bed (80mm x75mm) and also implemented a RGB LED socket for easy signaling of the diffent stages of the reflow process.
