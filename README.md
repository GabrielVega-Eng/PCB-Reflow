# PCB Reflow
 A PCB that can help you reflow and solder your SMD components! 

This project is my version of AfterEarthLTD Solder Plate Reflow (which is an awesome project!). 

## Version 1 - Integrated Heating Bed

I decided that first recreate the concept with more afordable component and add some more funcionality, so I used all PTH components and a Arduino Nano for the MCU. 

The board has a bigger heating bed (80mm x75mm) and also implemented a RGB LED socket for easy signaling of the diffent stages of the reflow process.
